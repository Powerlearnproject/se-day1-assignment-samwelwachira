# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
software engineering is systematically engineering principle method, tools, develop maintained at high quality.
in the technology industry, software play a special role on creating of software applications and systems that power in many arears 
examples are communication, creation of real contect.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) change analysis, it identify and categorise who and what will be affected.
b) Release planning, this helps in upgrading or starting of new version of software development 
c) System implementation, this process of designing of how the information system should be created and is used to ensure the information system meets uality standard.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) planining,this the first phase that you need to gather business requirement from client.
2) requirement analysis, after the clients provide the requirement standy analysis what the client need form you
3) design, this the phase the software developer need to difine the technical methods to use and impliment on how to design the client work
4) coding,this the point developer analyze kinnly of the each coding language beagin programmed according to the coding phases
5) testing, this phase is the main now that provide me as a developer test and ensure my entire application works acoordinly
6) deployment,it is the phase that me as developer take my work to the customer or client in a live production area
7) maintenance, this is the final part of the project that me as developer present my work to customer and the customer monitors the software to ensure it contines to operate in good condition.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order while agile is flexible iterative 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer, are used to programming and design knowledge to build software that meet the need to be used 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
most common is advance of technology
time constraint
software test conflicts 
changing of requirement 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit, this is testing applicatiopn digitaly.it ensure stability and resilence by validating the quality of a person 
system,this is very important for visibility into a stable final product 
integration,this ensure the system work polite together and identifying and correcting the issue before the final product 
acceptance, it is very important to verify all the systems work corretive to it manner

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
This the practise of degigning inputs for AI tools that will produce correct output
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is the process where you guide generative artifcial answer.
this prompt engineeriong method provide time as you can do alot of work without bicaming fatige

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

tell me evertthing, 
i will call you back, 
just give me some, 
this vague prompts help mostly in daily basic to people that improve good communication and have simple and good language that can be understood by everyone
